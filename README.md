# ARMTox86

### Purpose
This program takes in ARM assembly and converts it to x86 assembly. The input can be from a string, or the program can take input from a file and write to a file. 

### Working Convertions
mov, add, sub, mul, push, pop, bit shifts, branching, conditionals, data/labels

### Test
Run the program: It will read in the ARM assembly from input.txt, and it will spit out the x86 assembly to output.txt
